Hi! This is the first post on the new blog, I would like you to get to know a little better my approach to current issues that also affect the art industry. The content contained here will be an amalgamation of all my life experiences, but there will be a few words about me to start with. Ever since I was a child, I have been fascinated by philosophy. That’s why what I do in my life, is a reflection of what the word originally described. I am a man who is curious about the world. My studies gave me quite a broad knowledge of psychology and sociology, and I was most interested in the mechanisms shaping human attitudes both in the personal sphere and concerning society as a whole. This made me sensitive to the methods the centers of power use to influence people. I also learned about the most important mechanisms governing human behavior and experienced first-hand how important it is to live in harmony with one’s conscience to stay healthy. I found the current system so flawed that the best solution, in my opinion, is to stop supporting it, because participation  does not solve the problems, but gives fuel for further abuses. This is why I put self-development first, trying to acquire as wide a range of skills as possible. I have just reached a place that forces me to limit my area of interest. This is not because I have difficulty learning, but because life is too short to master everything.
Many studies confirm the effect of stimulation and learning, in increasing WAIS test scores. It is therefore natural that a lack of stimulation will result in a gradual impairment of key cognitive functions. Let me use an example. If, as a healthy person, we start walking on crutches, we weaken our legs. But it is not the legs that define a person but the mind, which is why we cannot allow something to take us out of thinking and decision-making. Such a threat is nowadays the very rapidly developing artificial intelligence. Leaving aside the questionable moral aspects of using intellectually protected works, AI can undermine human cognitive abilities. It prompted me to develop my skills in new areas such as programming. It has taught me how to use AI daily, but it has also given me a stronger motivation to develop my mind’s abilities.
