Clue Notepad is very simple solution preventing cluedo fans from unnecessary waste of precious paper. :)
I'm fan of this game personally. 

One of the greatest pros of a game is it's power to increase abilities of our brains, particularly memory. We all have bad days, or just don't want to override our heads. Then, we need something to write everything we know about current game play. The "default" solution (very often attached by producers to the game in form of printed notes) it is a piece of paper, where we need to note everything and create a tabble for this purpose. And here is my solution I created years ago, but I never reveal it to the public. It's very simple app, which creates all of this for you. Just turn it on, setup names of the players (remember to confirm by pressing enter), and use it like regular paper one. After all, click "clear" and You can start over.

App contains layouts for few most common  versions of the game.
There is internationalisation for english and polish only.

 Future development:
	<br><br>
*  add more localisations<br>
*  taking names of local players (same network) to place their names into the tabbles automatically (future plan),<br><br><br>
