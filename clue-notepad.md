Clue Notepad is a very simple solution preventing Cluedo fans from unnecessary waste of precious paper. :)
I'm a fan of this game personally. 

One of the greatest pros of a game is its power to increase the abilities of our brains, particularly memory. We all have bad days or just don't want to overload our heads. Then, we need something to write down everything we know about the current gameplay. The "default" solution (very often provided by producers with the game in the form of printed notes) is a piece of paper, where we need to note everything and create a table for this purpose. And here is the solution I created years ago, but I never revealed it to the public. It's a very simple app, which creates all of this for you. Just turn it on, set up the names of the players (remember to confirm by pressing enter), and use it like a regular paper. After all, click "clear" and you can start over.

The app contains layouts for a few most common versions of the game. There is internationalization for English, Polish, German, and French only. The main goal was to create an app light, comfortable and as easy to use as it is possible. That means you will see no ads as well.

Future development:

<br><br>

* add more localizations<br>
* taking names of local players (same network) to place their names into the tables automatically<br>
* add the possibility to save preferences (low priority)<br>
